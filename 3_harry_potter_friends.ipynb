I do this by looking at a small region of +/- 6 tokens around the central token to see which characters nearby tokens are associated with. Tokens that are close to the central token score higher; as do tokens that correspond to a character's first name. Finally tokens that follow \"professor\", \"Mrs.\", and \"Mr.\" also weight heigher. This is because tokens such as \"professor\" are associated with a lot of characters, but the following token most often identifies the character unambigously. "
